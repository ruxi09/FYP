In C++, it is possible to modify the assembly code of a branch statement by 
using inline assembly. Inline assembly allows you to insert assembly code 
directly into your C++ code, which can be useful for optimizing specific parts
of your program or for using processor-specific instructions that are not 
available in C++.

Here is an example of how you might use inline assembly to modify the assembly
code of a branch statement in C++:

In this example, the inline assembly code compares the values of x and y, and
then uses a conditional jump (jg) to jump to a label depending on the result of
the comparison. The code then moves either 0 or 1 into x depending on the 
result of the comparison, and then continues execution at the "done" label.

It is important to note that using inline assembly can be complex and 
error-prone, and it is generally not recommended unless you have a specific
reason to do so. In most cases, it is better to write your code in C++ and let
the compiler handle the assembly code generation.
